The combination of a cold front passing into the region and the proximity of the tropical storm to the area resulted in high winds across portions of far eastern OK and western AR. Trees, large tree limbs, and power lines were blown down, and some trees fell onto and blocked roads while some others fell on homes and businesses in northwest AR. Many areas in northwest AR were without power during the passage of the storm. Localized flash flooding occurred and eventually some river flooding resulted from Ike's rainfall."
